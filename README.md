a# Resume-Version-2

This is the second version of my online resume website, built as part of my front-end project. The site is designed to showcase my skills, experience, and various games I have developed.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML** - For the structure of the website.
- **CSS** - For styling and layout.
- **JavaScript** - For adding interactivity, such as games and dynamic features.

## Features

### 1. **Resume Overview:**
   - This website acts as my personal resume, showcasing my background and skills.
   - It includes multiple pages with detailed information about:
     - **About Me**: A personal introduction.
     - **Experience**: A timeline of my work experience.
     - **Projects**: Details about projects I've worked on.
     - **Volunteering**: Information on volunteering experience.
     - **Games**: A page where I showcase a few of my interactive games.

### 2. **Games Section:**
   As part of this project, I’ve also integrated interactive games that highlight my JavaScript skills:
   - **Tic Tac Toe**: A simple, interactive version of the classic Tic Tac Toe game.
   - **Kitten Doggy and Chicks**: An original game where the player can select a character and engage in a random character selection game with a fun story-based outcome.

### 3. **Timeline:**
   The **Timeline** section highlights my professional journey and the different stages of my career. It includes visual representations of what I’ve been doing and the skills I’ve acquired along the way.
