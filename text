Key Features Web Scraping & API Integration – Utilizes APIs when available; otherwise, employs web scraping techniques to extract data. Data Format Handling – Supports multiple formats (JSON, XML, CSV, and unstructured text) and standardizes them for consistency. Error Handling & Adaptability – Manages rate limits, CAPTCHAs, and website structure changes to ensure uninterrupted extraction. Automation & Scheduling – Enables periodic data extraction to maintain up-to-date records. Data Storage & Integration – Processes and stores extracted data for further analysis and visualization.

Learnings & Challenges Through this project, I explored: The limitations of APIs and their alternatives. Challenges in handling unstructured data from various sources. Techniques to improve web scraping efficiency while staying compliant with data access policies. Future Enhancements Expanding extraction to additional regions. Implementing data validation and quality checks. Optimizing performance and error recovery mechanisms.
